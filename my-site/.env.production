## Production environment variables for Vite
# Replace the value below with your production API base URL (no trailing slash is required after /api)
VITE_API_BASE="https://api.your-production-domain.com/api"

# Notes:
# - Do NOT commit secrets (API keys, credentials) to the repo. Vite env vars prefixed with VITE_ are embedded into the client bundle.
